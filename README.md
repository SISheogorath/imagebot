Image Bot
===

Many images are more or less unmaintained because the developers finished their works and now stop following the project.

This bot helps to keep projects up-to-date by informing the developer about a new version by opening a git issue.

It requires [`hub`](https://hub.github.com/) to be installed.

Use the `setup.sh` to install the project including hub. (for the project only)
